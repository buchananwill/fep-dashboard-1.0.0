# Work Project Series Schema

A **Work Project Series Schema** represents a *template* for creating a *group of tasks of the same type* (i.e. a
project), that will each be performed _once per [Cycle](#cycle)_. A Work Project Series Schema is thus a plan to perform
a certain amount
of a given [Work Task Type](#work-task-type) across the duration of a **Cycle**.

# Work Task Type

A **Work Task Type** has two sets of attributes:

1. Classification
    1. [Work Task Type Name](#work-task-type-name)
    2. [Knowledge Domain](#knowledge-domain)
    3. [Knowledge Level](#knowledge-level)
2. Resources
    1. [Provider Role Type](#provider-role-type)
    2. [Asset Role Type](#asset-role-type)

The **classifications** are used to give a Work Task Type its identity: no two Work Task Types can share the same set of
all three classification attributes. The **resources** are used to define what human or other physical resources are
needed when carrying out the task.

# Work Task Type Name

A **Work Task Type Name** is best conceived as a verb that can be applied to a range of scenarios. For example
*planning*,
*teaching*,
*delivering*, *assembling*, *assessing*, *advising* could be used as Work Task Type Names. They do not give information
about the *"what"* aspect of the object. These aspects are defined by the [Knowledge Domain](#knowledge-domain)
and [Knowledge Level](#knowledge-level).

# Knowledge Domain

A **Knowledge Domain** is difficult to define without resorting to tautology! As labels, knowledge domains are used to
compartmentalize expertise or understanding, to help us form expectations about context and relevancy. In a professional
setting, knowledge domains also guide expectations of competency. "Maths", "English Literature", and "International
Politics" would very likely not elicit the same expectations of context or relevancy from most people or situations.
Knowledge Domains can be arranged as a hierarchy of specifity, e.g. "Isaac Asimov" is a more specific Knowledge Domain
than "science fiction author". Specificity should be considered separately however from expertise or difficulty as an
attribute of [Work Task Type](#work-task-type) - for that a [Knowledge Level](#knowledge-level) is appropriate.
