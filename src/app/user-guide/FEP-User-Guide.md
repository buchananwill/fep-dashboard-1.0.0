# Future Education Paradigm

## Overview

Future Education Paradigm (FEP) is born of a single core principle: students want to learn, and teachers want to expend their work effort on helping students learn.
> The interface of curiosity with encouragement 
> is the essence of good teaching.
The most valuable resources available to any type of "school" are thus two things: 

- its teachers' time, and how it is distributed, 
- its students' engagement and how it is nurtured

FEP offers solutions to both these challenges:

- A flexible, powerful and scalable engine for solving multi-dimensional resource allocation problems
- A student-centered approach to delivering synchronized elective learning plans, maximizing the freedom of student choice.
