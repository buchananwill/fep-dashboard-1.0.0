# Future Education Paradigm

## Introduction

> The essence of good teaching is the regular interface of curiosity with encouragement

Future Education Paradigm (FEP) is born of a single core principle: students want to learn, and teachers want to expend their work effort on helping students learn.

The most valuable resources available to any type of "school" are thus two things: 

- its teachers' time, and how it is distributed, 
- its students' engagement and how it is nurtured

FEP offers solutions to both these challenges:

- A flexible, powerful and scalable engine for solving multi-dimensional resource allocation problems
- A student-centered approach to delivering synchronized elective learning plans, maximizing the freedom of student choice.

## Overview

> Make the solution as simple as possible, but no simpler.

There are **five core processes** when using FEP. In order from "least frequently used" to "most frequently used", they are:

1. [Baseline Data Entry](#baseline-data-entry)
2. [Work Plan Creation](#work-plan-creation)
3. [User Requirement Input](#user-requirement-input)
4. [Resource Management](#resource-management)
5. [Schedule Generation](#schedule-generation)

The goal is to build a data model of your institution that comprises:

1. How to divide up days into allocatable time units, and how a schedule work cycle repeats (e.g. 6 periods a day, repeating fortnightly).
2. What work
