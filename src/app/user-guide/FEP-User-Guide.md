# Future Education Paradigm

## Introduction

Future Education Paradigm (FEP) is born of a single core principle: students want to learn, and teachers want to expend their work effort on helping students learn.

> The interface of curiosity with encouragement 
> is the essence of good teaching.

The most valuable resources available to any type of "school" are thus two things: 

- its teachers' time, and how it is distributed, 
- its students' engagement and how it is nurtured

FEP offers solutions to both these challenges:

- A flexible, powerful and scalable engine for solving multi-dimensional resource allocation problems
- A student-centered approach to delivering synchronized elective learning plans, maximizing the freedom of student choice.

## Overview

> Make the solution as simple as possible, but no simpler.

There are five core processes when using FEP, in order of roughly increasing frequency:

1. [Baseline Data Entry](#baseline-data-entry)
2. Work Plan Creation
3. User Requirement Input
4. Resource Management
5. Schedule Generation
